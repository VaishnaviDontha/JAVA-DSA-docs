# : Flow Charts :

	- Start\Stop = Oval
	- Input\Output = Parallelogram
	- Processing = Rectangle
	- Condition  = Rhombus
	- Flow direction of a program = Arrow

	- These are used to visualise the Algorithm of a Prob. 

# : Pseudocode :
	
	- Rough code 

# : Optimisation of Code : 

	- Reduce repeatition of steps
